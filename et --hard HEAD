    feat: Implement UI text translation on language change
    
    This commit enables the dynamic translation of UI text components when you select a new language from the language dropdown in the settings.
    
    Key changes include:
    
    - Ensured `WeatherView` and its sub-components (displaying weather details, forecasts, charts) correctly react to language changes by re-fetching data (where applicable) and re-rendering their UI elements using the `TranslationService` with the updated language from `StateManager`.
    - Modified `LanguageToggleService` to remove incorrect theme-setting logic and a non-existent cache clearing call, and to align its language state management with the rest of the application.
    - Enhanced `PopMenu` and `SettingsAlertDialog` to observe language change events. They now update their own text elements (menu item names, dialog titles, section labels) and propagate language updates to their child components (e.g., `DropdownLanguage`, `DropdownMeasurement`).
    - Made the hint text in `DropdownLanguage` translatable.
    
    The overall translation flow relies on `StateManager` to manage the current language and notify interested components via a "language_event". Components then use `TranslationService` and the translations provided in `translations_data.py` to display text in the selected language.
